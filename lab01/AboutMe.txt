Hi! My name is Angela Guiï¼Œ and I am a frosh. I was born in Shanghai, China but I have lived my HS years mainly in NYC. In my free time, I enjoy drawing and painting, as well as playing indie survival games on Steam. My favorite restaurants in Shanghai is Yang's Dumplings and Da Yan Noodle Shop. My favorite restaurants in NYC are BCD Tofu House for Korean food, Lady M for desserts, and Boba Guys for bubble tea.
