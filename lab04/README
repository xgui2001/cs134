In this folder are several programs that currently do not run correctly.
In order of increasing debugging difficulty:
  * prime.py - test if an integer argument to the program is prime
  * shuffle.py - an implementation of rot13 encrpytion
  * rot13.py - an implementation of rot13 encrpytion
  * cribbage.py - scores cribbage hands
Each of these programs is documented in the docstring.

Each of these programs has several types of errors:
  1. Syntax errors.  Errors that keep the script from running correctly.
  2. Runtime errors.  Errors that occur when a computation experiences an error
     while running.
  3. Logic errors.  Errors that happen because the implementation of the
     algorithm is logically flawed.

Some of these scripts make use of code in tools.py, a file of code
that is correctly implemented and is not the source of errors.  In addition,
code marked "# WORKS" should be considered functional.

All code we have written included docstring-based tests that represent
expectations about how the program runs, but other tests may also be useful.
